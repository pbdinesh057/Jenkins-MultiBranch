- A multi-branch pipeline is a concept of automatically creating Jenkins pipelines based on Git branches. It can automatically discover new branches in the source control (Github) and automatically create a pipeline for that branch. When the pipeline build starts, Jenkins uses the Jenkinsfile in that branch for build stages. 

- You can add conditional logic to the Jenkinsfile to build jobs based on the branch requirement.


- SCENARIO - Took 3 AWS Accounts - Depending on branch DEV/UAT/PROD - the particular jenkins pipeline should start and deploy resourses accordingly

1. In GitHub - under profile - settings - developer settings - personal access tokens - create tokens
2. In Jenkins - Install (Blue-Ocean) plugin - open jenking thru blueOcean option on left side options - New pipeline - Multibranch - paste token and select our repo there - add webhook for our repo - New commits in different branches will run as seperate pipelines.
